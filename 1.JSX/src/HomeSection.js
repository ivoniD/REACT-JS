                        <br />
                        <br /> I am Alpha Cat, the leader of the coolest cat
                        gang in town and I'm here to open your eyes!
                        Let me tell you that we're not just talking about catnip
                        and scratching posts. This is a place where you can sit
                        back, relax and let the cat mistery begin.
                        <br /><br/>
                        You might be asking yourself, why are cats so darn cool?<br/>
                        Well, let me tell you, we have nine lives worth of
                        knowledge and sass that we're ready to share with you.
                        And you're lucky to be here, trust me.<br/> <br/>Not
                        everyone gets an invitation to our exclusive cat club.
                        So, grab a ball of yarn, turn up your purr-fect playlist
                        and get ready to have a meow-valous time. <br/>We've got
                        all sorts of cat facts that
                        will have you saying "I never knew that about cats!"<br/><br/>
                        Don't be shy, humans. We don't bite...unless you're a
                        mouse.
                        <br />
                        <br />
